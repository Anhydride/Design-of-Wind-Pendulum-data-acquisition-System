<h1> Wind pendulum data acquisition system </h1>
&emsp; &emsp; The accelerometer module MPU-6050 is used to measure the data of the wind pendulum Angle sensor, and the STC89C52RC MCU is used to read the tilt Angle, angular velocity and other data from MPU-6050, and then the data is displayed by LCD1602. <br>
&emsp; &emsp; The STC89C52RC microcontroller was used to read out the acceleration and Angle from the MPU6050. In order to facilitate data reading, LCD1602 is applied to display A (x, y, z axis acceleration from left to right) and G (roll, pitch, yaw axis acceleration from left to right), which is more intuitive and convenient. <br>
